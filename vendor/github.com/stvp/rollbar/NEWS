0.1.0 - June 27th, 2014
=======================

Important: this release changes the grouping of errors in Rollbar. Be sure to
test if the grouping of errors in Rollbar is important to your Go projects.

* Errors are now fingerprinted by the full stacktrace (filen ames, method
  names, and line numbers). This significantly improves the grouping of errors
  in Rollbar. Contributed by @kjk
* File paths now omit unneeded prefixes. Contributed by @kjk
* Add severity constants (`rollbar.CRIT`, etc.)
* Fix `Close()` call on nil responses. Thanks @Soulou!
* Increase default buffer size to 1,000.

* When an empty API token is set, all `rollbar` methods will be
  no-ops.

0.0.3 - November 25th, 2013
===========================

* Remove incorrect "root" value that was being sent. That setting
  is meant for the path to the root code directory, but we're running compiled
  binaries, so it doesn't make sense to submit that value.

0.0.2 - November 11th, 2013
===========================

* Add `Wait()` command to wait for all errors to be sent to
  Rollbar.
* Simplify reported error class for `errors.errorString` errors.
